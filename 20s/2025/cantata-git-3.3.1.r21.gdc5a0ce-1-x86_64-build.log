CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:808 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindKF6Archive.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "KF6Archive", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "KF6Archive" with
  any of the following names:

    KF6ArchiveConfig.cmake
    kf6archive-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "KF6Archive" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "KF6Archive_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "KF6Archive" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
