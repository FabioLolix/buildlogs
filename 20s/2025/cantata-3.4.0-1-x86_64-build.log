CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:805 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindKF6ItemViews.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "KF6ItemViews", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "KF6ItemViews" with
  any of the following names:

    KF6ItemViewsConfig.cmake
    kf6itemviews-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "KF6ItemViews" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "KF6ItemViews_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "KF6ItemViews" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
