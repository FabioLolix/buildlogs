CMake Error at engine/CMakeLists.txt:100 (FIND_PACKAGE):
  By not providing "FindSDL2_IMAGE.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "SDL2_IMAGE", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SDL2_IMAGE" with
  any of the following names:

    SDL2_IMAGEConfig.cmake
    sdl2_image-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "SDL2_IMAGE" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SDL2_IMAGE_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "SDL2_IMAGE" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
